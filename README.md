updating

We will upload our active model learner for CoAP and AMQP as we are cleaning up the identity information in our code.

We will upload three adapters for MQTT, CoAP and AMQP protocol, a semantic extractor (include an integrator), a translator, helping oracles and some examples.

We are building a docker for the reproducing our results.
